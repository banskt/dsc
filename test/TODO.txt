- module name cannot start with `pipeline_`
- module names have to be SQL compatible
- Make sure populate_table works robustly when RDS files are missing
- check whats going on with transcript export
- None when there is a mixture of R and Python via `+` logic
- add a line of best practice: do not use `library()`
- add exec `depend` property to track source files
- force test alias for derived blocks. Maybe no need for it with new interface
- a more self-contained way to load DSC related functions -- maybe a little companion R package eventually?
- task/nontask file signature problem
- identical tasks will result in complaint. check for identical jobs ie same parameter twice
