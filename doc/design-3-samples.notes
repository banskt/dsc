# [Location parameter estimate I|@https://github.com/stephenslab/dsc2/tree/master/vignettes/one_sample_location/settings.yaml@] and [II|@https://github.com/stephenslab/dsc2/tree/master/vignettes/one_sample_location_winsor/settings.yaml@]
# [Adaptive Shrinkage|@https://github.com/stephenslab/dsc2/tree/master/vignettes/ash/settings.yaml@]
# Adaptive Shrinkage on variance [version 1|@https://github.com/stephenslab/dsc2/tree/master/vignettes/vash/settings.yaml@] and [version 2|@https://github.com/stephenslab/dsc2/blob/master/vignettes/vash/settings_per_method.yaml@]
## Version 2 is equivalent to version 1 but differ in style: unlike version 1 which organizes logically similar methods into the same block, version 2 keeps all methods in separate DSC blocks.
# [Outlier detection from population data I|@https://github.com/stephenslab/dsc2/tree/master/vignettes/outlier_r/settings.yaml@] and [II|@https://github.com/stephenslab/dsc2/tree/master/vignettes/outlier_snakemake/settings.yaml@]
